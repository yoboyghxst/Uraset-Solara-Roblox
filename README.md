# Uraset Solara:

This is a Roblox Script called "Uraset". There's 2 types of Urasets. Uraset Original and Uraset Solara. This one right here is URASET SOLARA. That means it supports an executor called Solara, but it also support other low level executors.
IF YOUR EXECUTOR'S UNC IS VERY LOW, SOME FUNCTIONS MAY NOT WORK (including ESP).

# Uraset ORIGINAL:

Uraset Original is another script that you can see in my github that is made specifically for core executors/emulators for example Vega X, Evon, Wave, Arceus X and etc... It has ONLY 4 functions BUT it's really only made to display arsenal hubs
SO if you want to use URASET AS A HUB, Use URASET SOLARA. But if you're on an emulator, run Uraset ORIGINAL then THUNDEDR CLIENT; one of the best hubs for arsenal.
